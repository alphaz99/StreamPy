    """
    A stream is a sequence of values. Agents can:
    (1) Append values to the tail of stream and
    close a stream.
    (2) Read a stream.
    (3) Subscribe to be notified when a
    value is added to a stream.
    (See Agent.py for details of agents.)

    The ONLY way in which a stream can be
    modified is that values can be appended to its
    tail. The length of a stream (number of elements
    in its sequence) can stay the same or increase,
    but never decreases. If at some point, the length
    of a stream is k, then from that point onwards, the
    first k elements of the stream remain unchanged.

    A stream is written by only one agent. Any
    number of agents can read a stream, and any
    number of agents can subscribe to a stream.
    An agent can be a reader and a subscriber and
    a writer of the same stream. An agent may subscribe
    to a stream without reading the stream's values; for
    example the agent may subscribe to a clock stream
    and the agent executes a state transition when the
    the clock stream has a new value, regardless of
    the value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str, optional
          name of the stream. Though the name is optional
          a named stream helps with debugging.
          default : 'NoName'
    proc_name : str, optional
          The name of the process in which this agent
          executes.
          default: 'UnknownProcess'
    initial_value : list or array, optional
          The list (or array) of initial values in the
          stream.
          default : []
    stream_size: int, optional
          stream_size must be a positive integer.
          It is the largest number of the most recent
          elements in the stream that are in main memory.
          default : DEFAULT_STREAM_SIZE
                    where DEFAULT_STREAM_SIZE is
                    specified in SystemParameters.py
    buffer_size : int, optional
           buffer_size must be a positive integer.
           An exception may be thrown if an agent reads an
           element with index i in the stream where i is
           less than the length of the stream - buffer_size.
           default : DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE_FOR_STREAM
                     specified in SystemParameters.py

    Attributes
    ----------
    recent : list
          A list of the most recent values of the stream.
          recent is a NumPy array if specified.
    stop : int
          index into the list recent.
          s.recent[:s.stop] contains the s.stop most recent
          values of stream s.
          s.recent[s.stop:] contains padded values.
    offset: int
          index into the stream used to map the location of
          an element in the entire stream with the location
          of the same element in s.recent, which only
          contains the most recent elements of the stream.
          For a stream s:
                   s.recent[i] = s[i + s.offset]
                      for i in range(s.stop)
    start : dict of readers.
            key = reader
            value = start index of the reader
            Reader r can read the slice:
                      s.recent[s.start[r] : s.stop ]
            in s.recent which is equivalent to the following
            slice in the entire stream:
                    s[s.start[r]+s.offset: s.stop+s.offset]
    subscribers_set: set
             the set of subscribers for this stream.
             Subscribers are agents to be notified when an
             element is added to the stream.
    closed: boolean
             True if and only if the stream is closed.
             An exception is thrown if a value is appended to
             a closed stream.
    _buffer_size: int
            Invariant:
            For every reader r of stream s:
                 s.stop - s.start[r] < s._buffer_size
            A reader can only access _buffer_size number of
            consecutive, most recent, elements in the stream.
    _begin : int
            index into the list, recent
            recent[:_begin] is not being accessed by any reader;
            therefore recent[:_begin] can be deleted from main
            memory.
            Invariant:
                    for all readers r:
                          _begin <= min(start[r])

    Notes
    -----
    1. AGENTS SUBSCRIBING TO A STREAM

    An agent is a state-transition automaton and
    the only action that an agent executes is a
    state transition. If agent x is a subscriber
    to a stream s then x.next() --- a state
    transition of x --- is invoked whenever messages
    are appended to s.

    The only point at which an agent executes a
    state transition is when a stream to which
    the agent subscribes is modified.

    An agent x subscribes to a stream s by executing
            s.call(x).
    An agent x unsubscribes from a stream s by
    executing:
            s.delete_caller(x)


    2. AGENTS READING A STREAM

    2.1 Agent registers for reading

    An agent can read a stream only after it registers
    with the stream as a reader. An agents r registers
    with a stream s by executing:
                   s.reader(r)
    An agent r deletes its registration for reading s
    by executing:
                   s.delete_reader(r)

    2.2 Slice of a stream that can be read by an agent

    At any given point, an agent r that has registered
    to read a stream s can only read some of the most
    recent values in the stream. The number of values
    that an agent can read may vary from agent to agent.
    A reader r can only read a slice:
             s[s.start[r]+s.offset: s.stop+s.offset]
    of stream s where start[r], stop and offset are
    defined later.


    3. WRITING A STREAM

    3.1 Extending a stream

    When an agent is created it is passed a list
    of streams that it can write.

    An agent adds a single element v to a stream s
    by executing:
                  s.append(v)

    An agent adds the sequence of values in a list
    l to a stream s by executing:
                   s.extend(l)
    The operations append and extend of streams are
    analogous to operations with the same names on
    lists.

    3.2 Closing a Stream

    A stream is either closed or open.
    Initially a stream is open.
    An agent that writes a stream s can
    close s by executing:
                  s.close()
    A closed stream cannot be modified.

    4. MEMORY

    4.1 The most recent values of a stream

    The most recent elements of a stream are
    stored in main memory. In addition, the
    user can specify whether all or part of
    the stream is saved to a file.

    Associated with each stream s is a list (or
    array) s.recent that includes the most
    recent elements of s. If the value of s is a
    sequence:
                  s[0], ..., s[n-1],
    at a point in a computation then at that point,
    s.recent is a list
                    s[m], .., s[n-1]
    for some m, followed by some padding (usually
    a sequence of zeroes, as described later).

    The system ensures that all readers of stream
    s only read elements of s that are in s.recent.

    4.2 Slice of a stream that can be read

    Associated with a reader r of stream s is an
    integer s.start[r]. Reader r can only read
    the slice:
               s.recent[s.start[r] : ]
    of s.recent.

    For readers r1 and r2 of a stream s the values
    s.start[r1] and s.start[r2] may be different.

    4.3 When a reader finishes reading part of a stream

    Reader r informs stream s that it will only
    read values with indexes greater than or
    equal to j in the list, recent,  by executing
                  s.set_start(r, j)
    which causes s.start[r] to be set to j.


    5. OPERATION

    5.1 Memory structure

    Associated with a stream is:
    (1) a list, recent.
    (2) a nonnegative integer stop  where:
       (a) recent[ : stop] contains
           the most recent values of the stream,
       (b) the slice recent[stop:] is
           padded with padding values
           (either 0 or 0.0).
    (3) a nonnegative integer s.offset where
          recent[i] = stream[i + offset]
             for 0 <= i < s.stop

    Example: if the sequence of values in  a stream
    is:
               0, 1, .., 949
    and s.offset is 900, then
       s.recent[i] = s[900+i] for i in 0, 1, ..., 49.

    Invariant:
              len(s) = s.offset + s.stop
    where len(s) is the number of values in stream s.

    The size of s.recent is the parameter stream_size
    of s. Recommendations for the value of stream_size
    are given after a few paragraphs.

    The maximum size of the list that an agent can
    read is the parameter, buffer_size. Set
    buffer_size large enough so that the size of
    the slice that any agent wants to read is less
    than buffer_size. If an agent is slow compared to
    the rate at which the stream grows then the
    buffer_size should be large. For example, if
    an agent is reading the element in the stream
    at location i, and the stream has grown to l
    elements then buffer_size must be greater than
    l - i.

    (In later implementations, if an agent reads
    a part of stream s that is not in s.recent, then
    the value read is obtained from values saved to
    a file.)

    The entire stream, or the stream up to offset,
    can be saved in a file for later processing.
    You can also specify that no part of the stream
    is saved to a file. (Note, if the stream s is not
    saved, and any agent reads an element of the
    stream s that is not in main memory, then an
    exception is raised.)

    In the current implementation old values of the
    stream are not saved.

    5.2 Memory Management

    We illustrate memory management with the
    following example with stream_size=4 and
    buffer_size=1

    Assume that a point in time, for a stream s,
    the list of values in the stream is
    [1, 2, 3, 10, 20]; stream_size=4;
    s.offset=3; s.stop=2; and
    s.recent = [10, 20, 0, 0].
    The size s.recent is stream_size (i.e. 4).
    The s.stop (i.e. 2) most recent values in the
    stream are 10 followed by a later value, 20.
    s[3] == 10 == s.recent[0]
    s[4] == 20 == s.recent[1]
    The values  in s.recent[s.stop:] are padded
    values (zeroes).

    A reader r of stream s has access to the list:
      s.recent[s.start[r] : s.stop]
    So, if for a reader r, s.start[r] is 0,
    then r has access to the two most
    recent values in the stream, i.e.,
    the list [10, 20].
    If for another reader q, s.start[q]=1,
    then q has access to the list [20].
    And for another reader u, s.start[q]=2,
    then u has access to the empty list [].

    When a value v is appended to stream s, then
    v is inserted in s.recent, replacing a padded
    value, and s.stop is incremented. If the empty
    space (i.e., the number of padded values) in
    s.recent decreases below buffer_size then a
    new version of s.recent is created containing
    only the buffer_size most recent values of the
    stream.

    Example: Start with the same example as the previous
    example with buffer_size = 2

    Then a new value, 30 is appended to the stream,
    making the list of values in s:
    [1, 2, 3, 10, 20, 30]
    s.stop = 3; s.offset is unchanged (i.e. 3) and
    s.recent = [10, 20, 30, 0].
    Now the size of the empty space in s.recent is 1,
    which is less than buffer_size. So, the program sets
    s.recent to [20, 30, 0, 0], keeping the buffer_size
    (i.e. 2) most recent values in s.recent and removing
    older values from main memory, and it sets s.stop to
    buffer_size, and increments offset by
    s.stop - buffer_size. Now
       s.stop = 2
       s.offset = 4
